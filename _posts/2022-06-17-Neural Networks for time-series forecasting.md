So you want to forecast your sales? 

Or maybe you would like to know the future price of bitcoin?

In both cases, you are trying to solve a problem known as "time-series forecasting". A time-series is a set of values that varies depending on time.

No one can predict the future, but one can search in the past looking for patterns, and hope that those are going to repeat.

Guess what is very good in finding patterns? Neural networks!
